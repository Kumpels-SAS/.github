== Making commits

Commit your changes when you are happy with them.
But remember that a commit should only contain changes relevant to its message.

Summarize changes in around 50 characters or fewer.

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary, will be put on the body.
Wrap it to about 72 characters or so, max 80.

The first line is treated as the title of the commit and the rest of the text as
the body.

The blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog` and `rebase` can get
confused if you run the two together.

The commit title must complete the phrase "If applied, this commit will ...",
like this:

* If applied, this commit will _Refactor subsystem X for readability_
* If applied, this commit will _Update getting started documentation_
* If applied, this commit will _Remove deprecated methods_
* If applied, this commit will _Release version 1.0.0_
* If applied, this commit will _Merge pull request #123 from user/branch_

Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you are making
this change as opposed to how (the code explains that). Are there side effects
or other unintuitive consequences of this change? Here's the place to explain
them.

Paragraphs will come after blank lines.

Bullet points are okay, too. Use an asterisk, preceded by a single space, with
blank lines in between in case your items exceeds 80 chars.

Put references to the issue tracker at the bottom, like this:

----
Fix #123
See also #456, #789
----

Always follow these rules:

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")

* Limit the first line to 72 characters or fewer

* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

* Capitalize when possible following grammar rules

* Do not end the title line with a period

* Do not assume everyone understands what the original problem was, ensure you add it

* Do not think your code is self-explanatory

* Start the commit message with the corresponding emoji (gitmoji):
